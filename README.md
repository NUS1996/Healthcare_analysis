## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is an **interactive healthcare dashboard** built in **Excel** to analyze patient demographics, hospital admissions, and key healthcare insights. The dashboard provides a **comprehensive overview** of hospital emergency statistics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  

## 📌 Key Insights & Features  
✅ **Patient Visit Trends** – Analyze patient visit patterns over time.  
✅ **Age Group Analysis** – Identify the most common age groups admitted.  
✅ **Department Performance** – Compare hospital departments based on patient satisfaction.  
✅ **Admission Type Segmentation** – Categorize patients by their admission types.  
✅ **Wait Time & Satisfaction Scores** – Track patient experience metrics.  
✅ **Demographics Breakdown** – Insights based on gender and race distribution.  

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Data preparation was crucial for accurate insights. Here’s how the data was cleaned:  
1️⃣ **Power Query** – Standardized text formatting for consistency.  
2️⃣ **Data Type Corrections** – Assigned appropriate data types to prevent errors.  
3️⃣ **Age Grouping** – Used `SWITCH` function for better demographic analysis.  
4️⃣ **Patient Stay Duration** – Calculated days admitted using `DATEDIFF`.  
5️⃣ **Year Extraction** – Enabled year-based filtering for trend analysis.  
6️⃣ **Billing Status Classification** – Used `IF` conditions to categorize payments.  

## 📊 Pivot Table Analysis  
Pivot tables were used to extract **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as:  
🔹 **Total Patients & Revenue**  
🔹 **Insurance Analysis** – Amount covered by insurers  
🔹 **Top 10 Hospitals** – Based on revenue & patient count  
🔹 **Credit & Billing Insights** – Min/Max billing per patient  

## 🎨 Dashboard Creation  
After data processing, an **interactive dashboard** was built using:  
- **Slicers** for dynamic filtering  
- **Pivot Charts** for trend visualization  
- **KPI Cards** to highlight key metrics  
- **Bar & Line Charts** for patient distribution insights  

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Charts)**
